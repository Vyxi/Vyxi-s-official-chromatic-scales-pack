Koipi No More has been cancelled for many reasons, with the main one being the fact that i have disrespected C's (That's how i call them now to hide their identity) wishes to drag them into drama, claiming them as the victim of child predators. I sincerely apologize to C for forcedly including them into a partially resolved drama and falsely claiming to defend them, when in fact i've done jackcrap actually. From now on, i will leave C alone and let them rest. 

Due to KNM's cancellation, it has separated into multiple upcoming and cancelled mods, which are VS Schlaudude, Bubble Funk and others.
